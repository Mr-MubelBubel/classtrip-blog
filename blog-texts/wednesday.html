        Hey guys, day three was beginning. The night was a little bit better, but also cold. The first thing this day was eat breakfast. At 8.30 a.m. we had the daily meeting, where we get the information about the day. On the plan standed: Interaction, Scotland Yard and Individual responsibility.<br><br>
        The first was the Interaction. This was a big class training. The target was to strengthen class cohesion. We had to jump rope. First, we all jumped over it alone and then in pairs. Finally, everyone had to jump over at the same time. We had some problems with some of the things, but we did it. The second thing was that we were given plates to stand on and had to move to another side with them. That took a long time, but it went without problems. Last but not least, we had to stand on a narrow bench. Then we had to arrange ourselves according to the alphabet with the names without anyone touching the floor. There were crazy things, and I didn’t that my class could be solve these challenges, but we solved it. It was quite interesting.<br><br>
        After this we went to lunch. Afterwards we played Scotland Yard. We had all talkies to communicate except the X-group. There had another channel as we. The X-group had three minutes to hide themselves in the camp. The other groups must be searching the X-group. The group with the most hidden time would be win. It was very funny to hunt the X-team. The last round was not very nice, because one group found out how we can change the channel. So, they can find the X-team faster. But in all it was a great thing.<br><br>
        According to this exhausting action we went to the dinner. It was urgent need to eat something. Unfortunately, it was just a little too little. The last action was the individual responsibility. We decided to play different team games. One big one was viking chess. We played in two games. At the end it started to rain. My team won it and we could quickly go in our tents.<br><br>
        This was our third day of the class trip. This day we didn’t talk long. We fell asleep very quickly.<br><br>
