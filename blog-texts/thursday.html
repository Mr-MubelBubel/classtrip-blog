        Hey Ho! This was the last day with nice activities. The night was better than the others and I slept very well. The first thing this day was eating breakfast. This was very important, because the activities were very exhausting, but more on that later. Like every day we had the daily meeting. Our activities for this day were: SUP (stand up paddling), canoe polo and at the end disco. This plan was very very nice!<br><br>
        The first one was stand up paddling or sup. We retrieved the boards from the little house. We must have to wear life jackets. We wore the boards to the port edge. On one board were two people. One with a sup paddle and one with a normal canoe paddle. The most one of us were sitting on the board. It was very wobbly on the boards, but I had made a lot of fun. The target was a little beach near the port. The weather on this day was wonderful. I think it was 89°F. The sun was shining and made good spirits. We all started together. I thought it was kind of nice that the teachers were also there. Because quite honestly, you usually want to have your peace in front of them. The ride to the beach was quite pleasant. Erik and I were usually the first with Phil our tour guide. He was very nice had understand a lot of fun. Arrived at the beach we made a break for, I think, one hour. There we played frisbee and in the second part volleyball. It had made a lot of fun and it was interesting. I think it was the first time that all people of the class had a lot of fun. After one hour we made our way back. One people, I forgot his name, came with a motorboat. On the way back Phil was riding the boat. This was not good for all, because Phil was making waves with the motorboat. This made a lot of fun because we could ride the waves with the board. My intension was not to go or fall into the water, but Phil saw it differently. He takes the paddle from Erik to push me into the water, but he failed. It was funny. The whole tour I didn’t fall into the water.<br><br>
        Back in the camp we played volleyball before we went to the lunch. At the lunch it was like every day. Very tasty but not enough.<br><br>
        Next came canoe polo. This was quite interesting. We got the canoes from the little house and bring them to the little beach with the bathing area. In addition to the canoes, we retrieved life jackets. Additionally, we tightened wetsuits because the water was a little bit cold. One of us went into the water without a wetsuit. Respect! We learned how we are steering the canoe and how we play the ball to other people. Moreover, Gustav showed me how I should paddle. After that we play. The goal was to shoot into the gate and get points for our team. My team played all three games. It makes a lot of fun, but it was also very exhausting. If a canoe would overturn, the guy went out of the game and change with another team member. In the middle of the second game, I changed with a team member. At the end our team wins. This was a very funny experience, especially with my class.<br><br>
        After that we went to the dinner. This was very necessary, because the games were very exhausting, and the day was exhausting too. 7.00 p.m. started the disco. The disco was for all people in the camp. My intension was not to go to the disco. I looked one time there, but it was not funny. At the end classmates came to Robert and asked him to go to the disco and I heartened him to go. He said that if I came with him, he would go. So, we went to the disco and there we dance. In retrospect, it was quite funny and a lot of fun.<br><br>
        The day was interesting, funny, and very energy-sapping, but I made many experiences.<br><br>
