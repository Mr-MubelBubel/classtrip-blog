        Hey guys! Day two about our class trip. The night was very cold and I have been freezing badly. 8 oâ€™clock was breakfast and 8.30 a.m. was the daily meeting. Our plan for this day was a canoe trip in the morning a digital team tour in the afternoon and campfire in the evening.<br><br>
        So, we start with canoe trip to a beach near the port. We wear the canoes out of the little house next to the port. We were seven persons in one canoe. Six people rowed and I controlled the canoe. When everyone had the canoes out and were sitting in them, we started. It was a wonderful day with warm sunshine with a leeward breeze. My canoe was the second after the canoe with our trip guide. The last one was the canoe with Mrs. Cossa. They drove sloping lines. That was funny xD. Finally came any canoe to the beach. On the spot we could play volleyball, but I make a break. I took a sunbath, and I enjoyed the sun. After I think one hour we started back to the port. Our canoe was three quarters of the route the first but the last 218 yard we were the last. But it was very funny to paddle into the port. The tour was interesting and a little bit exhausting too, but it was also very relaxing for example at the beach.<br><br>
        Up to the lunch we played volleyball with our sport teacher. With such good weather it was a lot of fun. The lunch was a bit too little, but it smelled fine.<br><br>
        Next was the digital team tour. This was interesting. We received tablets and we must solve tasks with a group of 5-6 persons. The tasks were distributed over the camp. Any tasks were also outside of the terrain. The nice thing was first we must walk to the exercises and then we can solve the tasks. The tasks were in the forest, who was around the lake and the camp too, and in the forest were many mosquitoes. Any of us had so many stitches. That was so funny.  A few tasks were hard to solve, but also these tasks solved my team. My group solved a big part of the tasks and at the end we were the first team.<br><br>
        Following we played volleyball again. Of course, we played a lot of volleyball in this week. After playing we had dinner. The same problem as at lunch, but just as yummy.<br><br>
        The last thing for the day was the campfire evening. We eaten popcorn and hot marshmallows. By the way we played a game. Mrs. Cossa brought a bag with slips of paper with numbers on them. Every number was for one question. The bag was given around and we must answer the questions. It was interesting to see other dreams, wishes or experiences from my classmates.<br><br>
        Finally, we went in our tents, and we talked quietly until we fell asleep.<br><br>
