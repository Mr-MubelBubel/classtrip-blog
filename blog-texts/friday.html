        This night was absolutely the best. It was warm and slept very well. This day was very stressful, because we left the camp this day. The night before, we had to pack everything as much as we could because there wasn't much time on Friday. We went to the breakfast and strengthened us one last time. Next, we bring the bag packs out of our tents and wait. A responsible person then took down the tents. So, whether they were neat and clean. After this our bus came. We must wait for a while until we were allowed on the bus. The journey back was relaxing. We arrived back home safely.<br><br>
        This was the trip with my class. In any moments very crazy and funny and in other things only interesting and with many experiences. The most days were very exhausting and fun. For the first time I felt I had a place in the class. That was nice.<br><br>
